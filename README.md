üìå Overview
This toolkit is designed for authorized security professionals to assess Windows 10 vulnerabilities in controlled environments. It provides a suite of offensive security tools to evaluate system defenses, report findings, and demonstrate proof-of-concept exploits.

Key Use Cases:

Red Team Exercises - Simulate real-world attacks

Blue Team Training - Help defenders recognize attack patterns

Security Audits - Identify system weaknesses




üîç Deep Dive: Features
1. System Intelligence Gathering
Harvests network configurations, installed software, and hardware specs

Maps user privileges and system vulnerabilities

Exports data in structured reports

2. Surveillance Modules
Stealth Screenshot Capture: Operates silently with random intervals

Webcam Access: Single-frame capture without LED activation (on some devices)

Keylogging: Logs keystrokes with timestamp metadata

3. Operational Security
No Persistent Installation: Leaves minimal forensic traces

Gmail Exfiltration: Uses TLS-encrypted SMTP for secure data transfer

Dynamic Sleep Intervals: Avoids pattern-based detection




üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Scenarios
1. Security Research Labs
Test malware detection evasion techniques

Benchmark antivirus response times

2. Corporate Penetration Tests
Demonstrate phishing risks

Highlight data exfiltration vectors

3. Educational Environments
Teach intrusion detection methods

Analyze attack telemetry






‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Ethical Guidelines
Legal Compliance
Always obtain written authorization before testing

Never deploy on systems you don‚Äôt own/control

Adhere to GDPR/HIPAA regulations when handling data

Responsible Disclosure
Report vulnerabilities to system owners immediately

Never retain collected data beyond testing periods

Detection Risks
Enterprise EDR solutions may flag certain activities

Network monitoring can detect SMTP exfiltration

Physical webcam LEDs may activate on some models
